# **fillable-form**
self-explanatory

## **Description**
This is a sign up form for users who desired to be enter in the drawing for a 7-day cruise.
The users are asked to provide their name, email, phone number and country of residence.
If the user desires to sign up for postal mailings, checks the box and an additional form shows up where the user can input a physical address

## **Usage**
This a test of sorts, I was asked to collaborate with the web design team at work (not my department) and I have created this form to showcase my skills, the functionality does not extende beyond the extra form displayed on click but the 'live' project will require a server side connection.
I have made this page responsive only on two breakpoints.
A design team will provide the final product that will need to be replicated for web, responsiveness, accesibility standards and RECAPTHA will need to be added.
